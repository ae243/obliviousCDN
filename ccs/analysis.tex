\section{Security Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

%Discuss the security of the system in terms of the parameters.  For example, we should reason about the number of proxies that share a shared key with the origin (each proxy will not have a unique shared key with the origin, but they won't all share the same shared key with the origin).

\subsection{Number of Proxies and Keys}

\subsection{Increased Attack Surface}

{\bf Inferring content from popularity.}
An attacker inferring popularity of content based on the number of accesses and inferring the web page from the popularity.

{\bf Spoofing origin server content updates.}
An attacker who spoofs origin server content updates.

{\bf Guessing attacks.}
An attacker who is attempting to learn if a client is accessing a specific URL or not by submitting requests to see if they match other clients' requests (this should be fixed by adding blinding).

{\bf Inferring content based on content length.}
An attacker who infers the web page from the length of the content (or number of blocks).
