\section{Introduction}

The stakeholders in this 
example are the content publisher, the CDN, and the Internet users --- and each of these entities differ in what 
they have at stake.  Alice may be punished for publishing controversial content (such as content that 
goes against the current regime); the CDN 
may be held liable for controversial information (or copyright infringing content); the Internet users' 
privacy could be leaked.  Each stakeholder should be interested (and possibly worried) about the 
consequences of overreaching government access.  \system{} is a novel design that allows technologists to play 
a role in the way data is governed, and to protect users, operators, and publishers from an overreaching government (or 
conflicting jurisdictional policies).
