\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we've highlighted some of the privacy problems facing the world today: overreaching governments and conflicting jurisdictional policies on data.  We've separated data into to different classes and individually discussed the historical frameworks and cases that address the data, as well as ongoing decisions regarding the type of data. 

In addition, we have outlined some the existing literature and proposed systems for nation state surveillance avoidance, and we have pointed out the capabilities and shortcomings of existing methods.  Lastly, we call for future work in protecting the privacy of data, both in motion and at rest, from an adversarial government.
