\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper has highlighted many of the privacy considerations facing Internet users,
with the proliferation of cross-border geo-replicated content.  As data becomes
increasingly replicated across national boundaries, questions of variations in laws
and jurisdictions introduce considerable uncertainty around questions concerning
user privacy. Although many of these tussles are currently playing out in the legal
system, we believe that {\em technical} solutions are relevant to both debates,
and more work on technical systems may ultimately shape these ongoing debates. Given
the ambiguity and uncertainty that conflicting legal outcomes have introduced concerning
these questions, we believe that technical solutions that protect user privacy---both
for data in motion and data at rest---will become increasingly important in the
coming years. This paper is a call to arms for researchers to develop more of the
types of systems that we have highlighted, for both data in motion and data at rest.
