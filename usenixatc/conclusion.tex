\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We design \system{}, which provides oblivious content
distribution.  \system{} obfuscates data such that the CDN can operate without
having knowledge of what content they are caching.  This system not only
provides protections to CDNs, but also preserves client privacy by ensuring
that the CDN never learns the identity of clients that
make requests for content. %\system{} is robust against a strong adversary who
%has access to request logs at the CDN and can also join the system as a
%client, publisher, or CDN. 
Our evaluation shows that \system{} imposes some performance
overhead, %due to the cryptographic operations that allow it to obliviously cache
%content, 
but that this overhead is acceptable, particularly for the sizes of files
that make up common web workloads.
