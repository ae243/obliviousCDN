As publishers increasingly use Content Distribution Networks
(CDNs) to distribute content across geographically diverse networks, 
CDNs themselves are becoming unwitting targets of requests for both
access to user data and content takedown. From copyright infringement to
moderation of online speech, CDNs have found themselves at the forefront of
many recent legal quandaries. At the heart of the tension, however, is the fact
that CDNs have rich information both about the content they are serving and the
users who are requesting that content. 
This paper offers a technical contribution that is relevant to this ongoing tension
with design of an Oblivious CDN (OCDN); the system is both compatible with the existing
Web ecosystem of publishers and
clients and hides from the CDN both the content it is serving and the users
who are requesting that content. \system{} is compatible with the way that publishers
currently host content on CDNs. Using \system{}, publishers can use multiple CDNs
to publish content; clients retrieve content through a peer-to-peer anonymizing network
of proxies.
Our prototype implementation and
evaluation of \system{} show that the system can obfuscate both content and clients
from the CDN operator while still delivering content with good performance.
