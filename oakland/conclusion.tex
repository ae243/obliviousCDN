\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

As more and more content is distributed via CDNs, the more likely CDNs become 
the targets of data requests and liability cases.  We discuss why CDNs are powerful in terms of the information they know 
and can gather, such as a client's cross site browsing patterns.  In response to 
traditional CDNs' capabilities, we design \system{}, which provides oblivious content 
distribution. 

\system{} obfuscates data such that the CDN can operate without having knowledge of 
what content they are caching.  This system not only provides protections to CDNs, but 
also preserves clients' privacy.  We also show that \system{} has reasonable overhead due to the cryptographic operations 
that allow it to obliviously cache content.
