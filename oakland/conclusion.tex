As an emerging and important data privacy issue of where and how data is stored is 
facing Internet users today.  As CDNs become more popular, more content is 
distributed to more locations around the world, and subject to different jurisdictions' 
privacy laws.  We discuss why CDNs are powerful in terms of the information they know 
and can gather, such as a client's cross site browsing patterns.  In response to 
traditional CDNs' capabilities, we design \system{}, which provides oblivious content 
distribution. 

\system{} obfuscates data such that the CDN provides all the benefits of content 
caching without having knowledge of what content they are caching.  This system 
provides protections to all stakeholders--- clients, the CDN, and content publishers.  
We also show that \system{} has negligible overhead due to the cryptographic operations 
that allow it to obliviously cache content.  This system design is a first step in 
addressing the problem of conflicting jurisdictional data privacy policies and 
invites future work in this area.
