\section{Background}

\subsection{DNS}

DNS queries may reveal information that an Internet user may want to keep private, including
the websites that user is visiting and the IP address or IP subnet of the device that issued 
the initial query.  A third party who can observe communication between a client and a 
recursive resolver, a recursive resolver, or an authoritative server may be privy to various 
pieces of this information, depending on which part of the DNS query resolution they may see. 
Operators of recursive DNS resolvers may see individual IP addresses (which may correspond to 
an ISP subscriber, or perhaps an individual end-device) coupled with the fully qualified domain 
name that accompanies the query. Even in the case of authoritative resolvers, extensions to DNS 
such as EDNS0 Client Subnet may reveal information about the userâ€™s IP address or subnet to 
authoritative DNS servers higher in the DNS hierarchy.

\subsection{Existing Approaches}

Efforts such as DNS Query Name Minimization~\cite{dns_qname} and DNS over TLS~\cite{dns_tls} protect 
certain, orthogonal aspects of privacy for users. For example, neither of these approaches prevent 
the operator of a DNS server from learning which IP addresses are issuing queries for particular domain 
names. 

Efforts such as Quad9~\cite{quad9}, which aim to purge any information connecting 
queries to IP addresses, are aligned with our goals. Unfortunately, even 
though a DNS operator who aims to protect user privacy may purge this 
information periodically, a user has no guarantee that information that an 
operator learns might be retained, for operational or other purposes. Once 
such information is retained, of course, it may become vulnerable to other 
threats to user privacy, including data requests from law enforcement.
