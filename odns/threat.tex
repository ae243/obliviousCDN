\section{Threat Model \& Goals}
\label{sec:threat}

{\bf Goals.} We aim to achieve similar privacy goals as systems such as Quad9, by stricter 
means: Our goal is to prevent a DNS server from ever learning the IP address 
(or subnet) that is associated with a particular DNS query in the first place. 
Such a goal might seem intractable at first, given that any recursive resolver 
that issues a fully qualified DNS query would naturally have an associated source 
IP address (and, further, EDNS0 client subnet extensions may further reveal a 
clientâ€™s specific subnet).  


{\bf Threat Model.} We assume that the adversary can (1) eavesdrop 
on communications between clients and recursive resolvers, and between recursive 
resolvers and authoritative name servers; 2) request data (via subpoena/warrant) 
from any number of DNS operators; or (3) access data and logs (e.g., query logs) 
at any DNS server.
